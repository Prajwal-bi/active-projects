# Active Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects
Welcome to my portfolio of real-time Proof of Concepts (PoCs) I'm building to demonstrate practical experience in AI and ML.

## Ongoing Projects (June 2025)
- Customer Churn Prediction App (ML + Streamlit)
- Rice Leaf Disease Detection (CNN+ Tensorflow + Keras)
- Marketing Campaign Analysis (EDA + ML + Tableau)

Each project has:
- Clean notebook with full code
- README with use case + solution
- Deployment (app or dashboard)
